## Why Firebase?

1. Needed something for prototyping fast
2. Wanted Real-time Database
3. Work more closely with this as part of my stack.
4. Target audience isn't so large at this point so this platform is perfect.

## The future

Migrate to MongoDB for its scalability features when userbase gets larger.
